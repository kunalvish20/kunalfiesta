# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat sharing feature enables Open-Fiesta users to share their AI conversations with others through shareable URLs. This feature addresses the need for users to easily distribute interesting or valuable conversations without requiring recipients to have accounts or access to the original chat interface. The solution uses smart truncation and URL encoding to work within existing infrastructure constraints while maintaining conversation context and visual fidelity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Open-Fiesta user, I want to share my AI conversations via a simple link, so that I can easily distribute interesting discussions with colleagues, friends, or online communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a share button next to any chat in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable URL containing the conversation data
2. WHEN the shareable URL is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically copy it to the user's clipboard
3. WHEN the URL is copied THEN the system SHALL display a success notification confirming the action
4. IF clipboard access fails THEN the system SHALL provide an alternative method to copy the URL
5. WHEN a user shares the URL THEN recipients SHALL be able to access the conversation without requiring an account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As someone receiving a shared chat link, I want to view the conversation in a clean, readable format, so that I can understand the context and content without needing the original application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shared URL is opened THEN the system SHALL display the conversation in a dedicated read-only view
2. WHEN the shared view loads THEN it SHALL maintain the original visual style and layout of the chat
3. WHEN displaying the shared conversation THEN the system SHALL show the chat title and creation date
4. WHEN rendering messages THEN the system SHALL preserve all original formatting, timestamps, and model information
5. WHEN the conversation was truncated THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the viewer
6. WHEN viewing a shared chat THEN the system SHALL provide a way to navigate back to the main application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Open-Fiesta user, I want the system to intelligently handle conversations of different lengths, so that sharing works reliably regardless of conversation size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing a conversation with 20 or fewer messages THEN the system SHALL include all messages in the shared URL
2. WHEN sharing a conversation with more than 20 messages THEN the system SHALL include only the last 20 messages
3. WHEN truncating a conversation THEN the system SHALL preserve chronological order of the selected messages
4. WHEN truncating occurs THEN the system SHALL include metadata indicating the original conversation length
5. WHEN generating the URL THEN the system SHALL ensure it stays within browser URL length limits
6. WHEN encoding conversation data THEN the system SHALL use Base64 encoding for URL safety

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Open-Fiesta user, I want my shared conversations to be secure and private, so that sensitive information is not exposed through the sharing mechanism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating shareable data THEN the system SHALL exclude API keys and authentication tokens
2. WHEN encoding conversation data THEN the system SHALL exclude user account information
3. WHEN sharing a conversation THEN the system SHALL only include message content, timestamps, and model information
4. WHEN a shared link is created THEN it SHALL be publicly accessible to anyone with the URL
5. WHEN sharing project-based chats THEN the system SHALL only include public project context information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Open-Fiesta user, I want clear feedback about what is being shared, so that I understand the scope and limitations of the shared content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a share action THEN the system SHALL show a loading state during processing
2. WHEN sharing is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
3. WHEN sharing fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message with the reason
4. WHEN a conversation is truncated THEN the system SHALL inform the user how many messages are included
5. WHEN viewing the share button THEN the system SHALL provide tooltip text explaining the functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Open-Fiesta user, I want the share functionality to integrate seamlessly with the existing interface, so that it feels like a natural part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the chat sidebar THEN the share button SHALL appear next to existing chat management buttons
2. WHEN hovering over the share button THEN it SHALL display appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN the share button is styled THEN it SHALL match the existing design system and color scheme
4. WHEN the shared view page loads THEN it SHALL use consistent typography and layout with the main application
5. WHEN displaying notifications THEN they SHALL follow the existing toast notification patterns
